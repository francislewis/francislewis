### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Francis, a physics and philosophy graduate from the University of Bristol currently working as a Graduate Software Engineer at Vodafone UK. I code Python (and a bit of C) to simulate physics, analyse data and generally make my life easier! I'm currently teaching myself more machine learning alongside some other Python based projects.
